#TrojanDemo

A simple trojan framework built into git. It uses git to pull configs and modules to do its work. It also pushes its finds to git.  

Right now it is in an early stage while I base the framework and modules based on the methods found in Black Hat Python. I plan on integrating more modules and attack vectors into the virus. 

The program will be obfuscated and then compiled using py2exe
